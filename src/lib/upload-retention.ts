// Deletes lesson audio that outlived the job it belonged to.
//
// The happy path already deletes audio the instant the notes exist (see
// netlify/functions/process.mts). This module handles the two leftovers that path
// can't:
//
//   1. Failed jobs — the worker deliberately keeps the audio so /api/admin/recover
//      can re-run them. Nothing used to delete it afterwards, so it stayed forever.
//   2. Abandoned uploads — the client posted chunks and then never called
//      /complete (closed tab, lost connection). No job, no status, no worker, and
//      so nothing that would ever clean up.
//
// Both are swept AUDIO_RETENTION_MS after their last sign of life. That window is
// published in the privacy policy, which is the whole point of this file: the
// promise is only true because something enforces it.
//
// Next-free by design — the scheduled function (netlify/functions/purge-uploads)
// bundles this directly, and `next/*` isn't resolvable out there.
