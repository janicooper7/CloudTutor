//
// Flow: the client slices each track into ~4 MB parts and POSTs them to
// /api/upload/chunk (each part -> one blob). /api/upload/complete records a `job`
// + `status` blob and kicks the background function, which concatenates the parts,
// transcribes + drafts, writes the final `status`, and deletes the audio.
