// Route protection (Next.js 16 renamed Middleware → Proxy). Two rules, in order:

//   2. Dashboard auth — /dashboard requires a signed-in tutor, else /login.
//
// Uses only the edge-safe auth config (no DB import). Note that passing a
// handler to `auth()` means NextAuth's own `authorized` callback no longer
// drives the redirect (see node_modules/next-auth/lib/index.js — the
// userMiddlewareOrRoute branch wins over the !authorized branch), so rule 2 is
// enforced here rather than in auth.config.ts.
