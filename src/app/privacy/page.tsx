// Every factual claim here is checked against the code, and several of them are
// load-bearing:
//
//   - "transcripts are never stored in our database" — sessions has no transcript
//     column (src/db/schema.ts); the cached transcript blob is deleted with the
//     audio (netlify/functions/process.mts, src/lib/upload-retention.ts).
//   - the audio retention window — enforced by the daily sweep in
//     netlify/functions/purge-uploads.mts. LEGAL.audioRetentionDays must stay in
//     step with AUDIO_RETENTION_MS.
//   - "strictly necessary cookies only" — true because the project has no
//     analytics, tag manager, or advertising code of any kind.
//
// If you change what the product does with lesson data, change this page in the
// same commit.

          The practical consequence: your students are your responsibility. If a

      <Clause id="what-we-collect" heading="What we collect">
        <p>
          <strong>When you create an account.</strong> If you sign in with Google, we
          receive your name and email address from Google — nothing else, and never
          your password. We also store which plan you are on and when you signed up.

          <strong>What you type in.</strong> The student profiles you create: name and
          (optionally) email address, first language, level, learning goal, interests,
          areas to improve, any target exam, and your own private notes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What we record.</strong> When you start a lesson recording, BumbleNote
          captures two audio streams — your microphone and the audio coming from the
          lesson tab, which is your student. Recording only ever starts when you
          explicitly start it, and your browser shows its own indicator throughout.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What we generate.</strong> From the transcript: vocabulary covered,
          what went well, areas to improve, homework, a talk-time estimate, an observed
          level, suggestions for the next lesson, and your private teaching notes.

          This is the part most people want to know, so here is the whole sequence.
          Audio is uploaded in pieces, transcribed, analysed, and then deleted. The
          notes are what persist — the recording is not.

              <strong>If processing fails</strong>, the audio is kept for up to{" "}

              lost, and is then deleted automatically. The same applies to a recording

          recording a conversation vary by country, and in some places every

          being used and get their agreement. If they are under 18, that agreement
